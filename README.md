# SlowScroll - Chrome Extension

This extension artificially increases loading time for specified websites to reduce mindless browsing.

It works well for youtube and facebook, specifically their shorts videos. I have not tested on other websites as those are the ones I find myself mindlessly browsing the most. I didn't feel there was enough polish here to post it on the Chrome Web Store.
